# Business Directory App

## Visit

## The Project
The idea is to create a local business directory app for small communities.

The app would be handed over to an Authenticated User who would act as the data manager for the business directory.
For this reason, a simple and robust backend and a prominent focus on web accessibility are the priorities of this project.

## The Tech
- Supabase, given its all-in-one DB, storage and Auth solution, it's a perfect fit for the needs of the project.
- NextJS, chosen because it plays nice with Supabase, and the latest additions to Next 13 allow for easy routing and fast page loads.
- TypeScript, to help minimise errors in development.
- eslint
- Cypress, to ensure robustness, each UI component that a user (authenticated or otherwise) will be rigorously tested.
- axe-core, to scan for any accessibility errors in development.
- next-themes, a solution for top level colour theme changing in NextJS apps.
- formik, a form library for react.
